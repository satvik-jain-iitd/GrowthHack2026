## Context and Problem Statement

This is an ADR encapsulating the "routing logic" for when a foundational technology should be used by a particular team. In order to make the above determination as well as to identify overlaps and reduce redundancies in future development of these tools, an assessment on the Generative AI capabilities being offered by the tools and their implementations was conducted.
 
## Decision Drivers

In order to determine an initial recommendation, the two tools were evaluated based on the following criteria:

| Criteria                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Business - Fit to Purpose    | Items concerning primary functionalities for the solution.                                                                                                                                |
| Architecture / Modernization | Items on code quality and extensibility – a necessary consideration in an enterprise offering.                                                                                            |
| Future Proofing              | Concerns on expanding the chosen solution in future development iterations.                                                                                                               |
| Configurability              | Solutions will need to provide multiple functionalities to client applications and thus should be configuration-driven to simplify interactions.                                          |
| Observability                | These solutions would be leveraged by other client applications and will be deployed for enterprise use it is necessary to maintain observability throughout executions of their scripts. |

## Decision Outcome

Application usage of the above options by a Generative AI application development team will be conditional on their particular requirements, namely, the system type, composition of the team, software environment of the application, and non-functional characteristics of the application (primarily the execution mode) and application types supported. These will be the parameters by which a team should determine which implementation to be used for their Generative AI application. The prescription table provides a summary overview of the findings.
